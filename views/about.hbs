        Hi! I'm <strong>Xavier De Almeida</strong>. As a software developer with a spark for technology, I study at Georgian College. 
        Within and beyond the digital realm, technology and problem-solving have always been some of my primary interests.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #555; text-align: justify;">
        Apart from my love for coding, I enjoy working with cars and other mechanical components. 
        Modifying, repairing, or even welding different parts together is a pastime of mine. 
        I love trying to improve or restore parts to their optimum condition. 
        The hands-on experience I gain from working on mechanical systems helps me hone my troubleshooting skillsâ€”skills that 
        are highly beneficial when debugging and solving issues in coding.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #555; text-align: justify;">
        At Georgian College, I had the opportunity to take courses in a wide range of technologies such as Python, CSS, C++, C#, 
        Arduino, Node.js, Networking, Linux, and even advanced mathematics. These courses helped me build a strong understanding of different domains 
        such as front-end and back-end development, as well as hardware and software integration.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #555; text-align: justify;">
        I thrive in situations that are challenging and allow me to learn, be it engineering solutions to real-world problems 
        or programming and fine-tuning mechanical systems. With an extreme love for both technology and mechanics, I am able to 
        approach challenging problems with a more sophisticated blend of logic, reasoning, and hands-on skills.
